Hanging of the Man
==========

Hanging of the Man is an Android application based on the classic Hangman game.









During game play, the user should be allowed to hit the MENU button on the Android device (or emulator) to cause a menu to appear and allow the user to reset the game, or to open the settings menu. This menu should only appear during game play and not during display of the high scores.

Your app must come with default values for the appâ€™s two settings; those defaults should be set through a PreferenceActivity.

You must implement each of the numeric settings with a slider control.
